Absolutely — here’s the same **STOP command prep prompt** rewritten so Junie can implement it *in isolation*, with no mention of Basilica or future embedding plans:

---

**Prompt for Junie (Preparatory — Implement STOP command)**

Add a new **Basil keyword: `STOP`**, which halts program execution immediately but keeps the program’s entire state in memory, allowing it to be inspected or resumed later.

---

### **Intended Behavior**

* `STOP` suspends program execution at the point it is encountered.
* Unlike `EXIT`, it **does not unload the program** or clear variables.
* All user-defined variables, arrays, objects, classes, and functions remain active in memory.
* After a `STOP`, the interpreter enters an **idle interactive state**, where the user may:

    * View or modify variables.
    * Call functions or methods defined in the program.
    * Resume execution from the point after `STOP` (if supported by the CLI).
* `STOP` can appear anywhere in code—inside loops, functions, or conditionals.
  When reached, execution unwinds gracefully to the top level and halts further statement execution.

---

### **Mode-Specific Behavior**

* **CLI Mode (`basilc cli`)**

    * When a running program reaches `STOP`, execution halts and the user is dropped to the Basil prompt.
    * The loaded program remains in memory, and all defined symbols are accessible.
    * The user can examine variables, call functions, or manually continue execution (using the appropriate REPL command).

* **RUN Mode (`basilc run myprog.basil`)**

    * When `STOP` is encountered, execution halts but the program and VM context remain resident.
    * The process does not immediately terminate—this allows for future external control or resumption.
    * No prompt is shown; the runtime simply remains suspended.

* **TEST Mode**

    * `STOP` behaves identically to `EXIT` — it terminates the program and discards state.
    * (TEST mode is designed for non-interactive runs and automated checks.)

---

### **Implementation Notes**

* Add `STOP` to the keyword table and parser (no arguments).
* Modify the main interpreter loop to detect `STOP` as a clean suspension condition, distinct from termination or errors.
* Internally, add a VM state flag such as `Suspended`, and skip any teardown of variables or runtime context when this flag is active.
* Implement a way to **query or resume** a suspended VM later (`vm.is_suspended()`, `vm.resume()`, etc.).
* Ensure that `STOP` can be used safely within any scope — it should unwind execution cleanly and not raise exceptions.

---

### **Example Usage**

```basic
PRINT "Before stop"
X = 123
STOP
PRINT "This line runs after resume"
```

In interactive CLI mode:

```
> RUN "test.basil"
Before stop
Program suspended.
> PRINT X
123
> RESUME
This line runs after resume
>
```

---

### **Deliverables**

1. Add `STOP` to the parser, interpreter, and VM state machine.
2. Add a new internal VM state: `Suspended`.
3. Create `docs/reference/STOP.md` describing syntax and behavior.
4. Add example file `examples/stop_demo.basil` demonstrating suspension, variable inspection, and continuation.

---

That version gives Junie everything she needs to implement `STOP` *just within the Basil interpreter context*, without needing to know about the upcoming Basilica GUI.
